Water is crucial to all life forms. Civilizations have thrived where water is abundant and collapsed where it is scarce. It plays a vital role in maintaining ecosystems, agriculture, and human survival.  

## Key Facts:  
- **71%** of Earth's surface is covered by water.  
- The human body is **60% water**.  
- Filtration systems help clean water, but even the most **advanced systems fail to detect all contaminants**.
